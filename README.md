# Grid Solver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/turboMaCk/grid-solver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/turboMaCk/grid-solver)

This library provides general abstraction for solving grid layout problems.
The idea is to use **ordered list of items with dimmensions** and **number of columns**
to solve whole layout of grid. It's designed to be easy to use and extremly deterministic
abstraction with simple integration to any Html, SVG or Canvas based APP.
